You get a first sense of the amount of attention paid to teaching at the
College by the fact that Harvard felt the need to launch a ``Teaching and
Learning Initiative.'' You don't hear about the Red Sox launching a ``Winning
the World Series Initiative'' or Charlie Sheen launching a slightly-simpler
``Winning Initiative''---winning is a core part of their identity, not
something they have to initiate.

You get a second sense by the fact that this initiative was actually launched
four years ago and has languished until now. At a poorly-attended faculty
meeting in March, 2007, the few faculty in attendance received the ``Compact
on Teaching and Learning'' with disdain. A applauded remark by Professor of
Latin Katherine M. Coleman lay the blame, as always, at the feet of
distracted and disinterested students: ``Some students don’t come to class,
or they come late, or they surf the Web during lectures or even sections,
I’ve noticed.'' Obviously if someone fails to appreciate the wisdom and
clarity of your remarks, the fault must surely be theirs. But props for
noticing!

You get a third sense by observing that the College picked up this initiative
during a period of budget crisis, precisely at the moment when there are few
resources to devote to it. I should give credit where credit is due, however,
and point out that in a single year they did managed to organize
three---count them---colloquia to discuss this important subject.

But if you want the follow this disinterest to the source, go to graduate
school. Graduate school is where future academics learn their disrespect for
teaching.

Graduate students are taught that teaching is easy. One half-day course at
the Bok Center---all my department required---and you're ready to teach
section as a teaching fellow. Teach section for one class in a six year Ph.D.
program---all my department required---and you're ready to teach
undergraduates as a junior faculty member. As a result, most future academics
(including myself) enter their first academic position not knowing how to
design a class, write a full set of lectures, or balance our time between
research and instruction.

Graduate students are taught that teaching is not important. The reason
graduate students aren't required to teach more is that faculty want them in
the lab doing research. Research is what earns you a job, tenure, and
world-wide renown; teaching is a distraction. Graduate students with an
interest in teaching hear warning after warning that this is not the right
thing to do. ``You've taught enough.'' ``You need more papers on your resume,
not another class.'' ``Why are you so interested in teaching? Is your
research going OK?''

Departments even establish incentives to discourage graduate students from
teaching. I was required to teach one semester, and when I chose to keep
teaching I was not paid for my labors. Instead, the money I would have
received was routed to the my adviser, to pay him for my ``lost'' research
productivity. Of course, the research papers still had to get written, and so
at the end of the day I was working harder than I would have been doing
research alone and being paid the same amount.

Finally, graduate students are taught that teaching is unrewarding.
Researched-obsessed faculty consistently define impact in ways that bring
them either extra attention, money, or---ideally---both. Few seem excited by
the chance to inspire young minds, or driven to direct their considerable
creative and analytical powers towards transforming the learning process. My
former department has senior faculty who have contributed in many ways to the
broader Harvard community, but none of them stepped forward to transform
CS50.

In reality, teaching isn't what graduate students are taught. Teaching is
challenging, and only becoming more so as technology changes the educational
landscape. Change has always meant that teacher and student learn somewhat
differently, but today the pace of technological advance has widened this gap
substantially. Yet, even computer scientists are still delivering lectures as
if there was no YouTube, giving PowerPoint presentations as if there was no
iPad, and designing assignments as if there was no Wikipedia.

Teaching is important, and while that alone may sound somewhat obvious,
teaching is also important at research universities. If we don't find a way
to rebalance the incentives to ensure that Harvard faculty are creative and
accomplished both as teachers and as researchers, then at some point
prospective students and their families are going to see through the myth
that just hobnobbing with Rock Star Faculty constitutes an education.

So do these mythical creatures exist, the researcher who can teach, the
teacher who can do research? You might as well ask, are there baseball
players that can both hit and play defense, or is Charlie Sheen capable of
winning both here and there, like teaching, is challenging, important, and
fundamentally rewarding. But if we want to develop a new generation of
dynamic college educators, we have to start by changing what they are taught
in school.
